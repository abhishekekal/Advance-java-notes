core Spring annotations

1. @Component:- it makes a java classs as a spring component
            The @Components is used to mark the Java class in the Spring applications.
          The Spring IoC container manages the component annotations and is responsible for the lifecycle of the components, such as initializing, creating, or destroying them.
        As a result, components can represent any object in the application, including services and controllers. 
        Also, when the Java class marked the @Component annotation, Spring Boot detected the components with the help of the classpath.

ex 

@Component
public class Emp {

   public void fun()
  {
   sop("hello");
   }

}


main file --

 @Autowired
 private Emp e1;

@Override
public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
			
this.st.studying();
this.e1.fun();
}
