1 What is Servlet?
	- It is server side technology 
	- It is used to handle client(browser) side request to process the request and generate dynamic response
	
2 Servlet Life Cycle?
	1 init => only once it is invoked 
	2 service => doget => It invokes many more time 
	3 destroy => it invoked only once 
 1 . init() method: The Servlet.init() method is called by the Servlet container to indicate that this Servlet instance is instantiated successfully and is about to put into service.
//init() method

public class MyServlet implements Servlet{
   public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {
        //initialization code
   }
    //rest of code
}
service() method: The service() method of the Servlet is invoked to inform the Servlet about the client requests.
This method uses ServletRequest object to collect the data requested by the client.
This method uses ServletResponse object to generate the output content.
// service() method

public class MyServlet implements Servlet{
    public void service(ServletRequest res, ServletResponse res)
    throws ServletException, IOException {
            // request handling code
    }
    // rest of code
}
destroy() method: The destroy() method runs only once during the lifetime of a Servlet and signals the end of the Servlet instance.
//destroy() method

public void destroy()
As soon as the destroy() method is activated, the Servlet container releases the Servlet instance.



	
3 How to get Data from parameter?

. Using GET requests with query strings:

In this method, the data is appended to the URL of the request as a query string. The format is typically like this:

http://yourserver.com/your_servlet?param1=value1&param2=value2
Within your servlet, you can access the parameter values using the getParameter() method of the HttpServletRequest object

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

  @Override
  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
    String param1Value = request.getParameter("param1");
    String param2Value = request.getParameter("param2");
    
    // Process the parameter values here
    
    // ...
  }
}

4 How to create servlet project?
Step 1: Create a Dynamic web project
Step 2: servlet-api.jar file 
Step 3: Create Servlet Class
Step 4: Implement the Logic


do get vs do post method 


doget :- 
	-> only the limited amount of data can send it  because data is send in heder 

	-> not secured because data is show into the url
	-> get can be the bookmarked it 
	-> get request is idempotent. it means second request  will be ignored  until response of first request  delivered

do post:-

	-> in case of post large amount of data can be send because  data is sent in body 
	-> post request is secured because data is not exposed in url 
	-> post request can not bookmark it
	-> post method not idempotent






Today's Lecture Agenda
1 Send Response of Html format
2 Servlet collabration

- Call from one servlet to another servlet is called servlet collabration. We can add another HTML file (i.e. call from one servlet to another html file).
To perform servlet collabration task we have to required an object of request Dispatcher.
Request disppachter object we can obtained from HttpServletRequest 

3 Request Dispatcher


The RequestDispatcher interface provides the facility of dispatching the request to another resource it may be html, servlet or jsp.
This interface can also be used to include the content of another resource also. It is one of the way of servlet collaboration.

for the calling the servlet used 2 method 

1 request dispatch :- 
2 redirect    can do with the help of cookies

request dispatch;- 
 for the calling the request  dispatch 
 create the bject of this request dispatch
like RequestDispatcher rd=req.getRequestDispatcher("sq");
rd.forward( req,res );


the one servlet to the another servlet send the data is called the 
session management  


It is Interface 

- It has 2 methods 
	- forward(request,response)
	- include(request,response)
- In This case URL is not Change

Limitation of RD-
  -When we forward the request it does not get destroyed, while submitting some sensitive information it creates a problem of data redundancy (i.e. repetation) so we must avoid  use of request disppachter. To overcome this problem send redirect method comes into the pictures. This method is directly called using an object of HttpServletResponse
response.sendRedirect("url");  

4 Forward
5 include
6 Session Management 



httpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse 



httpServletRequest :-  it is the interface

	-> conseder this 2,3 are the two values  client  can send this values to the server
	-> request is the object that can hold this values
	-> 
	


HttpServletResponse:-  it is also the interface

	->  servlet can send the response  to the client  with the help of httpservletResponse object
	-> all the format  data can send it ( text , html , video)
